I am a Ph.D. student advised by [Prof. M. Khalid Jawed](https://structures.computer/team) at the [Structures-Computer Interaction Lab](https://structures.computer/) in the University of California, Los Angeles. Prior to coming to UCLA, I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Hanyang University, where I was advised by Prof. Wei Wang, at the [Soft Robotics Lab](https://softrobotics.wixsite.com/home).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
